### 4. Code Quality

#### Clean Code Principles

- [ ] README updated if setup/configuration changes

### 5. Performance & Security

#### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Appropriate use of async/await
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Frontend bundle size is reasonable
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for normal operations

#### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks

- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (if applicable)

### 6. Database & Infrastructure

- [ ] Migrations run successfully
- [ ] Database indexes added for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Foreign key constraints properly defined
- [ ] Seed data updated (if applicable)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing data

### 7. CI/CD Requirements

- [ ] All frontend tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum requirements
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Security scan passes (if configured)
- [ ] Docker build succeeds (if applicable)

### 8. Review & Merge

  - [ ] What was changed
  - [ ] Why it was changed
  - [ ] How to test
  - [ ] Screenshots (for UI changes)
- [ ] PR linked to issue/ticket (if applicable)

### 9. Post-Merge

- [ ] Feature branch deleted
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Team notified of significant changes
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts configured (for new features)

## Tech Debt Policy

**No tech debt should be introduced. If unavoidable:**
- [ ] Tech debt is documented in code with TODO comments
- [ ] Ticket created for tech debt remediation
- [ ] Team agrees on timeline for addressing
- [ ] Technical debt does not compromise security or data integrity

## E2E Testing Framework Requirements

### Tools & Technologies
- **E2E Framework**: Cypress or Playwright
- **Visual Testing**: Percy or Chromatic
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core integration
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI
- **API Testing**: Postman/Newman or REST Client

### Test Data Management
- Test data should be isolated and reproducible
- Database seeding for E2E tests
- Cleanup after test execution
- No dependency on production data

## Definition of "Working"

A feature is considered "working" when:
1. It performs its intended function correctly
2. It handles edge cases gracefully
3. It provides appropriate user feedback
4. It integrates seamlessly with existing features
5. It maintains or improves overall system performance
6. It doesn't break any existing functionality
7. All E2E tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
8. UI is accessible and responsive across all supported devices
9. Performance metrics meet defined thresholds

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this DoD must be:
- Documented in the PR
- Approved by the team lead
- Have a follow-up ticket created
- Not compromise system security or stability
