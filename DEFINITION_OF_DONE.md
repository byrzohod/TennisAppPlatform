# Definition of Done (DoD)

## Overview
This document defines the criteria that must be met before any feature can be considered complete and ready for production.

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Branch Strategy
- [ ] Create a new feature branch from main: `feature/<feature-name>`
- [ ] Branch name follows naming convention
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with main before starting work

### 2. Implementation Requirements

#### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Domain entities and value objects created/updated
- [ ] DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) defined
- [ ] Service interfaces defined
- [ ] Service implementations completed
- [ ] Repository patterns implemented (if needed)
- [ ] Controllers with all CRUD operations (as applicable)
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Logging added for important operations
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested

#### Frontend Implementation (if applicable)
- [ ] Components created with proper TypeScript typing
- [ ] Services for API communication implemented
- [ ] Forms with validation
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Loading states and error states

### 3. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- [ ] **Backend Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
  - [ ] Service layer unit tests
  - [ ] Controller unit tests
  - [ ] Domain logic tests
  - [ ] Validation tests
- [ ] **Frontend Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
  - [ ] Component unit tests
  - [ ] Service unit tests
  - [ ] Utility function tests

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] All happy path scenarios tested
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization tested (if applicable)

#### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Component tests with user interactions
- [ ] Form validation tests
- [ ] Service integration tests
- [ ] Routing tests (if applicable)

#### E2E Tests (for user-facing features)
- [ ] Critical user journeys tested
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### 4. Code Quality

#### Clean Code Principles
- [ ] SOLID principles followed
- [ ] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle applied
- [ ] KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle followed
- [ ] YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle applied

#### Code Standards
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] No linting errors (ESLint for frontend, analyzer warnings for backend)
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Proper naming conventions used
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements in production code

#### Documentation
- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear naming
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] Public APIs have XML documentation (C#) or JSDoc (TypeScript)
- [ ] README updated if setup/configuration changes

### 5. Performance & Security

#### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Appropriate use of async/await
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Frontend bundle size is reasonable
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for normal operations

#### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (if applicable)

### 6. Database & Infrastructure

- [ ] Migrations run successfully
- [ ] Database indexes added for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Foreign key constraints properly defined
- [ ] Seed data updated (if applicable)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing data

### 7. CI/CD Requirements

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] All frontend tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum requirements
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Security scan passes (if configured)
- [ ] Docker build succeeds (if applicable)

### 8. Review & Merge

#### Pull Request
- [ ] PR created with descriptive title
- [ ] PR description includes:
  - [ ] What was changed
  - [ ] Why it was changed
  - [ ] How to test
  - [ ] Screenshots (for UI changes)
- [ ] PR linked to issue/ticket (if applicable)
- [ ] PR is small and focused (< 400 lines changed preferred)

#### Review Process
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] Code review feedback addressed
- [ ] Approved by at least one reviewer

### 9. Post-Merge

- [ ] Feature branch deleted
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Team notified of significant changes
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts configured (for new features)

## Tech Debt Policy

**No tech debt should be introduced. If unavoidable:**
- [ ] Tech debt is documented in code with TODO comments
- [ ] Ticket created for tech debt remediation
- [ ] Team agrees on timeline for addressing
- [ ] Technical debt does not compromise security or data integrity

## Definition of "Working"

A feature is considered "working" when:
1. It performs its intended function correctly
2. It handles edge cases gracefully
3. It provides appropriate user feedback
4. It integrates seamlessly with existing features
5. It maintains or improves overall system performance
6. It doesn't break any existing functionality

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this DoD must be:
- Documented in the PR
- Approved by the team lead
- Have a follow-up ticket created
- Not compromise system security or stability

*This Definition of Done should be treated as a living document and updated as the team's practices evolve.*
